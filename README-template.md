## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned
-I learned how to use the overflow
-I was able to deeply understand how to import a font
-I was able to understand more of how the classes and span works


### Continued development
Generally, I would like to keep learning more about the CSS custom properties and how to use them.


### Useful resources

- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com) - It really helped me understand how the importing of a font works,even though i had to use the font-face,it help me understand how i can download and import them on my own.
